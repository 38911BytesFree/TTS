# Text-to-Speech (TTS) Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension that provides text-to-speech (TTS) functionality. It allows users to select text on a webpage and have it read aloud using the Speech Synthesis API. The extension automatically detects the language of the selected text and uses the appropriate language for speech synthesis.

## Features

- **Read Selected Text**: Right-click on selected text to get an option to read it aloud.
- **Stop Reading**: Stop the speech synthesis with a click of a button.
- **Language Detection**: Automatically detects the language of the text and uses the appropriate voice for speech synthesis using the `franc-min` library.
  
## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tts-extension.git
   cd tts-extension
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   The project uses `npm` to manage dependencies. Install them using:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:

   Use the following command to build the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Package the Extension**:

   To package the extension into a zip file for installation in Chrome, run:

   ```bash
   npm run zip
   ```

   This will create a zip file (`tts.zip`) that you can load as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

5. **Load the Extension in Chrome**:

   - Open `chrome://extensions/` in your browser.
   - Enable **Developer Mode** (top right).
   - Click **Load unpacked** and select the extension's root directory or the `tts.zip` file.

6. **Test the Extension**:

   Select some text on any webpage, right-click to bring up the context menu, and select "ðŸ”Š Read Text" to hear the selected text aloud. The language will be detected and used for speech synthesis. You can stop the speech by selecting "ðŸ”Š Stop Reading."

### Dependencies
- **`franc-min`**: This library is used to detect the language of the selected text.
- **`@types/chrome`**: Provides type definitions for Chrome extensions.
- **`webpack`**: Used for bundling the extension.
- **`bestzip`**: Used to create the zip file for packaging the extension.

### Build and Zip Scripts
- **`npm run build`**: Runs `webpack` to bundle the extension.
- **`npm run zip`**: Uses `bestzip` to package the extension files into a zip file (`tts.zip`).

## Development

### 1. **Building the Extension**

To build the project using webpack, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will bundle all the necessary files into the `dist` directory.

### 2. **Packaging the Extension**

Once the extension is built, you can create a zip file ready for Chrome by running:

```bash
npm run zip
```

This will generate a `tts.zip` file, which can be loaded into Chrome as an unpacked extension.
